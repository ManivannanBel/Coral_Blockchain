My Learnings.
  *I learnt many new things such as using handlebars template engine and partials in node js project.
  *Previously I only have experiance with Node js and mongoDB but now i have learnt to work with MySQL connection in Node js.
  *Learnt GO language but unfortunatly I cant able to make REST API using GO.
  *I never concentrated on front end in my previous experience but this time I worked pretty much with front end.
  *Connecting to MySQL for the first time in Node js was a bit challenging because I encountered with some errors.
  *Creating different routes was some fun i enjoyed creating them.
